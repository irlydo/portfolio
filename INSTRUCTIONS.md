-- Planning and inspiration:

I didn't look at another project for inspiration, as I wanted to create a minimal but sleek page which neatly contains all necessary sections, including Contact, About, Projects.

-- Tech stack:

For this project I used React with Routing and Links to dynamically create new segments when called by the user. I feel confident with this framework as it allows you to easily create new sections dynamically and is more modern than JSDom, for example.
